The schedule manager is not the most unique feature out there. It's almost necessary for both students and teachers. Although schedules aren't innovative, OpenSchool reinvented the management of the schedule management.

Depending on your schools type you can choose between multiple creation methods:
- Single student schedules (Students can manage them theirselves) mostly used by universities and high schools.
- Class schedules (Assign multiple students to a class and manage their subjects).

With this creation procedure there's no need for large meetings in which teachers manually assign their times.
Futhermore nobody needs to think about interferences lessons.
