OpenSchool pushes school management to the next level. With a modern web interface, an intuitive usage and its simplicity, every teacher will be a much happier person in no time.

Since the development process started OpenSchool works together with teachers from many schools to fit their needs and implement their features. Its whole purpose is to provide a free alternative to expensive school software.

## What can it do?

With OpenSchool teachers can:
- manage your classbook in a digital form 
- record student absence and share it with colleagues
- assign grades to students in their specific classes
- manage teachers and their classes (as principal)
- create seating plans in three different stages ([learn more](#seating-plan-views))
- manage documents in the cloud
- class room management

### Seating plan views
The seating plan can be edited in three different views:
- class view
- room view

The class view is the default way of displaying the seating plan. It is mainly used by German elementary schools.

### Record student absence
Sometimes students get ill, especially in times of the Corona virus. A very tricky task might be the recording of student absence. For that reason we implemented an easy way of documenting the times a student was missing.

## Why is it free?
Because it is an open source school management software. This educational software is licensed under "GNU v3".

The only possible pricing will be the installation or hosting proccess.

## Installation
### SaaS
Software as a Service describes a situation where you are not deploying or installing anything by yourself and use the software via your browser.
OpenSchool is going to offer such SaaS solutions (Check the [pricing][pricing]).

### Standalone
The counterpart where you need to install everything by yourself is called standalone. Read the documentation on how to install [OpenSchool][openschool] on your server.
