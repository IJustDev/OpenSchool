OpenSchool is a software project brought life to by [IJustDev][ijustdev].

## Why?
Unfortunately many schools still run an old, buggy and just bad software to manage the school. This comes in addition that there is no such thing as workflow, that can be planned. Everything is messy and you as a teacher or principal need to ask your colleagues for almost everything.

OpenSchool brings the best practice with state of the art technologies. It fixes the just mentioned issues in no time.
